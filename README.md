# blockcraft

A fairly basic voxel building game like Minecraft where you can build, destroy and explore the world around you as well as even customise the world that you load into to create an infinite amount of possibilities and adventures

# Menu Settings

World Size:

**World Size** : The width and height in chunks of the size of the world to be generated, the higher the number the more land there is to explore but the more memory the world will take up

**View Distance**: How far in front of you should the chunks be rendered, the higher the number the more chunks there will be in view

**Daylight Cycle**: When on the world will experience day and night for more realism but when turned off the world will remain in daylight forever and the sun will stay in the sky whilst also increasing performance

**Shadow Quality**:  How realistic the shadows will look in game, the lower the setting the faster the game will run

**Water Level**: The sea level in the game, the higher the number the higher the sea level (I recommend setting this to 0 if you wish to go cave exploring)

**Cave Intensity**: The chance of a cave spawning, the lower the number the less caves there will be and the higher the number the more large and deep caves there will be

# Devloper Options

You can open the developer tab in game by pressing "H" to customise and generate new worlds with your own settings:

**Octaves**: The smoothness of the landscape, the higher the number the more smooth the landscape is

**Height Multiplier**: The steepness of hills and valleys, the higher the number the steeper the landscape (numbers over 5 tend to break the game)

**Tree Spawn Chance**: A number between 0 and 100 which determines the chance a grass block has to spawn a tree on top of it, the higher the number the more trees get spawned

**Water Wave Height**: This determines the height of the waves, the bigger the number the taller the waves will be

**Water Wave Speed**: This determines the speed of the waves, the larger the number the faster the waves will travel
